# Basic Information
  - This repository stores the algorithms covered in CS6363, since I found that the best way to deeply understand one algorithm is to implement it and try to optimize step by step.
  - The original thoughts of all the implementation and optimization of the algorithm are from CS6363 class. Thanks to Professor Sergey Bereg for the intuitive guidence.
  - Stay tuned as this repository will update from time to time.
